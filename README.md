## Getting to Know Me

I am a software enthusiast based in Shenzhen.

With some experience in software development, I have traversed various domains including programming, management, and business. My career path has been dynamic, and Iâ€™ve accumulated knowledge across different fields. Hence, I maintain notes for future reference.

I also aim to provide guidance and outlines for those who wish to explore these domains.

As a lifelong learner, my interests range from reading and running to brewing coffee and software programming.
